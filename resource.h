DESCRIPTION:        Spins up an http web server and opens a console window and a
                    webpage pointed at localhost:666 in the systems default web
                    browser to show the built in html dashboard with options to
                    select and a submit button to submit the choices to the web
                    server.
                    The console displays actions made in the webpage once the
                    Submit button is pressed. The web page will also reflect the
                    actions chosen.

NOTES:              Simply a proof of concept code base template that can be expanded
                    upon later for numerous project types. This code does nothing but
                    display the actions/choices submitted in text form.
